"""Chat app assembly (R-005) — the WebSocket + chat REST surface over the R-004 DB-backed app.

``create_chat_app`` builds the merged R-003/R-004 auth app (``create_db_app`` — the sync
identity stack, untouched) and ADDS the R-005 chat layer onto it: the ``GET /v1/realtime``
WebSocket route, the chat REST router, and the per-app runtime context (the single-instance
connection registry + the inspection seam). No change to the auth app factory — the chat layer is
purely additive, so R-003/R-004 keep their exact behavior and exception handlers (AuthError ->
the LOCKED Error envelope; closed-schema 400; fail-closed 500) apply to the chat REST routes too.

The inspector defaults to the fail-closed NO-OP (``NoOpMessageInspector``). R-008 passes a real
:class:`MessageInspector` here with NO other change — the send pipeline already calls it
synchronously before persist + fan-out.

R-007 adds the single-instance ``HuddleManager`` (mirrors ``ConnectionRegistry`` — in-process,
ephemeral, no DB) and the ``ice_provider`` (self-hosted STUN/TURN bootstrap, ``realtime/ice.py``)
to the same runtime context; both are R-007's OWN implementation, not seams awaiting a later task.
